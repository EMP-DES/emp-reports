The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) sets water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun and San Pablo Bays. These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels. In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). These standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to the SWRCB discussing data collected.

"],["cwq-report.html", "Current Report Data and Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Benthic monitoring by the Environmental Monitoring Program is conducted monthly at 10 sampling sites distributed throughout several estuarine regions from San Pablo Bay upstream through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 2019 was designated a Wet water year for both the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley. Benthic communities in 2019 were expected be similar to previous Wet years (2011 and 2017) and differ from drier years both in species composition and in species abundances. Figure 2: Map of EMPs current benthic field sites. San Pablo Bay The most saline of our sites, D41 and D41A, are polyhaline sites in San Pablo Bay. At D41 in 2019, the most numerous species was the non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis, whose density peaked in July to 12,587 individuals per square meter, in a pattern seen primarily in wet years. Site D41 was also notable as the only site where we saw phoronids, also known as horseshoe worms, which are only found in this higher-salinity site. At D41A, there were high densities of the non-native amphipod Ampelisca abdita, which had a high of 9,846 individuals/m2 in December 2019, as well as Potamocorbula amurensis with an average annual density of 1,686 individuals/m2. Figure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41 in 2019. Figure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A in 2019. Suisun and Grizzly Bay In Suisun Bay and Grizzly Bay in 2019, our mesohaline sites D6 and D7 both saw high numbers of the invasive clam P. amurensis, which had an average density of 9,891 individuals/m2 and comprised 97% of all organisms at D6 in 2019, similar to other recent years. At D7, P. amurensis had a September peak of 12,471 individuals/m2, and the non-native amphipod Corophium alienense had a November peak of 10,428 individuals/m2. These two species together made up 94% of all organisms at D7 in 2019. Figure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6 in 2019. Figure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7 in 2019. Confluence At the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, site D4s oligohaline community was comprised in 2019 largely of the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne and Gammarus daiberi, which each had high variability through the year. The oligochaete worm Varichaetadrilus angustipenis also had high density in the second half of the year. Figure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4 in 2019. Central Delta In the Sacramento River, freshwater site D24 was dominated by the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, whose numbers averaged 3,016 per square meter over the course of 2019, similar to the very high densities of 2018. There was also a significant seasonal increase in densities of the amphipod Gammarus daiberi between September and December. In the San Joaquin River, freshwater site D16 (at Twitchell Island) was dominated in 2019 by the amphipod Gammarus daiberi, which demonstrated an impressive density peak in May, as well as the clam Corbicula fluminea and the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis. In Old River, freshwater site D28A had a diverse community in 2019. There were high densities of the ostracod crustacean Cyprideis sp. A and the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at the beginning of the year and lower densities for most of the rest of 2019. There were also seasonal peaks of the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis and the amphipods G. daiberi and A. spinicorne. Figure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24 in 2019. Figure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16 in 2019. Figure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A in 2019. Southern Interior Delta Further upstream in the San Joaquin River, site P8 at Buckley Cove was dominated by the sabellid worm M. speciosa which saw peaks in October and March. In addition to this species, which accounted for 59% of all organisms, site P8 saw a diverse community of freshwater oligochaetes, aquatic insects, and amphipods in addition to the non-native clam C. fluminea. At Clifton Court Forebay, freshwater site C9 was dominated by a number of annelid species in 2019. Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri,and Ilyodrilus frantzi were present at high densities throughout the year, at moderately higher levels than in 2018. The amphipod Hyalalla sp. A experienced a dramatic peak in density in November and December (Figure 11). Site C9 is regularly one of our most biodiverse sites, with an additional large number of species present at low densities. Figure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8 in 2019. Figure 12: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9 in 2019. Summary In summary, 2019 saw an overall decrease in invasive clam density from 2018 (13% for P. amurensis and 10% for C. fluminea). Other notable features of 2019 were the sharp decrease in overall density of the amphipod A. abdita in Grizzly Bay, after reaching a decadal peak in 2018, likely due to 2019s decreased salinity, as well as the 2019 increase in the annelid M. speciosa, after its steady decrease from 2015  2018. Our ability to recognize these changes highlights the importance of monitoring benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient since the community has important interactions with various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web.

"],["dwq-info.html", "Discrete Water Quality", " Discrete Water Quality Background Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as good or bad, since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it. Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous). Analytes EMP collects data for six different field parameters and 18 different laboratory constituents. The analytes highlighted in this report are: Specific Conductance Turbidity Dissolved Ammonia Chlorophyll a Dissolved Nitrate+Nitrite Total Phosphorus Sites To analyze discrete water quality trends, the 24 fixed EMP stations are grouped into six regions of the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary: San Pablo Bay, Suisun and Grizzly Bay, Confluence, Central Delta, Southern Interior Delta, and Northern Interior Delta. Their locations are displayed below. Figure 13: Map of EMPs field sites. "],["dwq-report.html", "Current Report Data and Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Water year 2019 was classified as Above Average in the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley, unlike the previous year, which was classified as Below Average. More information about water year types can be found on the hydrology page. The 2018-2019 data from all stations within the same region were plotted on one graph and then combined with the graphs from other regions to make a facet graph for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values in 2019 were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show the range within a single year. The instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was added to the graph to represent the presence of a non-detect. Specific Conductance Specific conductance varied greatly in 2019 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay and Grizzly Bay and Confluence) where water from the Pacific Ocean has the strongest influence. Specific conductance ranged from 77.8 µS/cm (C10A in Southern Interior Delta, June) to 41,956 µS/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, November) during 2019. Lower specific conductance values were seen in 2019 than compared to 2018, which was likely due to increased precipitation and runoff during a wet year, keeping the San Francisco Estuary fresher throughout the year. Figure 14: Surface specific conductance in µS/cm at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Turbidity Turbidity values ranged from 0.3 NTU (MD10A in Southern Interior Delta, April) to 142.3 NTU (NZ325 in San Pablo Bay, February) during 2019. The year 2019 had much higher levels of turbidity than in 2018, especially during the winter months in the northern and western regions when rain and snowpack runoff occurred more frequently and to a much larger degree in the watershed. All six regions experienced a spike in turbidity in February 2019 when the first set of big storms hit, causing higher flows throughout the estuary and therefore a higher likelihood of increased sediment disturbance. Figure 15: Surface turbidity in NTU at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Dissolved Ammonia Dissolved ammonia levels in 2019 ranged from  0.05 mg/L (which is the reporting limit) to 0.75 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, November). Dissolved ammonia levels are typically higher at C3A in the Northern Interior Delta due to its location downstream of the effluent discharge from Sacramento Regional Sanitation District. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. More non-detects were seen in 2019 compared to 2018, but this was in fact due to the reporting limit increasing from 0.01 mg/L to 0.05 mg/L and was not necessarily a product of lower concentrations. Figure 16: Dissolved ammonia concentrations in mg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll a values in 2019 ranged from  0.5 µg/L (which is the reporting limit) to 38.1 µg/L (C10A in Southern Interior Delta, July). The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the Southern Interior Delta region during the summer months in 2019. This was mostly due to elevated levels at station C10A, which is known for being shallow during dry periods of the year (as low as 3.5 feet in 2019), with increased temperatures and lower flows allowing for increased phytoplankton production. These elevated chlorophyll a levels in the summer at C10A also align with the continuous fluorescence data collected at this station. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Chlorophyll levels were consistently lower in 2019 than 2018 for all regions, as most regions saw a spike in chlorophyll in Spring 2018 that did not occur in 2019. Figure 17: Chlorophyll a concentrations in µg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite Dissolved nitrate + nitrite values ranged from  0.05 mg/L (which is the lowest reporting limit) to 3.6 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, January) in 2019. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Most regions saw a spike in dissolved nitrate + nitrite in late 2018 to early 2019, but all regions saw less variability in 2019 compared to 2018. Reporting limits for dissolved nitrate + nitrate were as high as 7.5 and 15 mg/L for western regions in late 2019 due to chloride influence on the analytical method. These reporting limits were cropped out of graphs for scale. The dissolved nitrate + nitrite values for D4 in January and D10 in November were removed from the graphs because they were outliers. Figure 18: Dissolved nitrate and nitrite concentrations in mg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Total Phosphorus In 2019, total phosphorous levels ranged from 0.04 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta-June, NZ068 in Northern Interior Delta-May, and D19 in Central Delta-May, D22 in Confluence-July) to 0.37 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, January). Total phosphorus concentrations were similar in 2019 compared to 2018 in most regions except for the Southern Interior Delta, which experienced lower levels in 2019. This was likely due to increased precipitation and more water moving through the system causing dilution. The total phosphorus value for NZ002 in April was removed from the graph because it was an outlier. Figure 19: Total phosphorous concentrations in mg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2018-2019. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect.

"],["benthic-info.html", "Benthic Invertebrates", " Benthic Invertebrates Background Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species. Benthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms. A large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and Californias commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary. Changes in benthic organisms populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition. Monitoring The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) has been sampling benthic invertebrates in the San Francisco Estuary since 1975. The benthic monitoring program is one element of DWRs and USBRs Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton. The overall objective of the benthic monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in benthic fauna presence, abundance and distribution associated physical factors in the estuary. Data collected from the benthic monitoring program is also used to detect newly introduced species in the estuary. Geographic coverage of the sampling sites ranges from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne and San Joaquin rivers (see Figure 1). The study area currently comprises ten sites that are sampled monthly. These sites represent a wide variety of habitats that vary in size and physical make-up as well as water quality and sediment composition. The aquatic habitats sampled range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. The mixing of river water with tidal water creates a wide range of water quality conditions. For example, salinity ranges from freshwater to around 29 ppt in the most western sites. A 0.052 m2 Ponar dredge is used to sample the benthic sediment, and all organisms larger than 0.5 mm are identified and enumerated by taxonomy contractors. To date, 414 species in ten phyla (Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata, Phoronida and Echinodermata) have been collected from the study area. Sediment composition data are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program to document general trends in sediment composition for all sites where benthic samples are collected. Figure 20: Map of EMPs benthic field sites (past and current). "],["benthic-meta.html", "Metadata", " Metadata Period of Record Benthic monitoring began in 1975. From 1975 through 1979 the program collected samples biannually from 18 to 35 stations, for a total of 48 stations over the period. In reviewing data collected between 1975 and 1979, it became evident that semi annual monitoring was insufficient to reveal long term ecological changes as mandated by Water Right Decision 1485. In 1980, DWR revised the benthic monitoring program and began monthly sampling at nine stations. In 1995, major program revisions were implemented to the program. A review of the data collected from 1980 to 1990 recommended that across-channel sampling be reduced to a single station per location in the Delta so that the geographic coverage could be widened. These revisions included increasing the number of sites sampled each month from nine to ten and increasing the number of grab sample replicates from three to four. Detailed information about location, number and characteristics of the historical sites can be found in IEP Technical Report 12 (Markmann, 1986) and IEP Technical Report 38 (Hymanson, et al., 1994). A programmatic review of the EMP in 2001-2002 found that the benthos monitoring element was particularly in need of fundamental and comprehensive consideration through intense special studies and study design examination. Reviewers recommended a temporary reduction in sampling frequency to free up EMP resources to conduct the more spatially intense sampling without requiring additional resources. October 2003 was the last of the monthly sampling events and sampling continued quarterly (in October, January, April, July) at the stations sampled through October 2005 when monthly sampling resumed. Sampling Frequency Biannual sampling was conducted in late spring and fall, from 1975 to 1979. Monthly sampling started in June 1980 and ended in October 2003. Samples were collected quarterly from October 2003 through October 2005. Currently samples are collected monthly. Sample Sites A list of the stations at which benthic invertebrate sampling has occurred is available here. Note: Coordinates are in decimal degrees, and channel position is determined while facing downstream. Field Collection Methods Benthos {.unlisted .unnumbered} All samples are collected using a hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge. The Ponar dredge samples a bottom area of about 0.052 m2 to a depth that varies with the type of sediment and the ability of the dredge to penetrate it. Under the current program four replicate sample grabs are collected at each sampling site. The contents of the dredge are brought to the surface and placed in a large plastic bucket. Water is then added to the sample to create slurry. The contents of each grab sample bucket are washed over Standard No. 30 stainless steel mesh screen (0.595 mm openings). Each sample is carefully washed with a fine spray to remove as much of the substrate as possible. All material remaining on the screen after washing is preserved in a solution of approximately 20% buffered formaldehyde containing Rose Bengal dye for laboratory analysis. The benthic macroinvertebrate sampling methodology used in this program is described in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20th ed. 1998 American Public Health Association, Washington D.C. (See pages 10-60 through 10-74.) | #### Sediment {.unlisted .unnumbered} Sediment samples are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program. Samples are collected using the same hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge as the infaunal sampling. A single sediment grab is taken at each sampling site. The contents of the Ponar dredge are emptied into a plastic tub and a random subsample is placed into a 1-liter plastic jar for storage and transport to the DWR Soils Laboratory for analysis. Lab Processing Methods Benthos At the laboratory, the volume of settleable substrate in each sample jar is estimated and recorded. The formalin fixative is poured off and the sample is thoroughly washed on a 30-mesh (0.6 mm) screen. The composition of the substrate is estimated and recorded noting the relative percentages of peat, sand, mica, organic detritus, and other materials. The substrate is hand picked for organisms under a three diopter illuminated magnifier. Organisms are placed in 70% ethyl alcohol for subsequent identification. A stereoscopic dissecting microscope (70-120x) is used to identify most organisms. When taxonomic features are too small for identification under the dissecting scope, the organism is permanently mounted on a slide and examined under a compound microscope. If more than four hours of picking is required, and a sample contains many organisms but few species, a one-fourth subsample is chosen at random. The subsample is picked and the results are multiplied by four to represent the total sample. The remainder of the sample is inspected to make sure no other taxa were overlooked. Laboratory identification and enumeration of macro-benthic organisms in each sample is performed under contract by Hydrozoology Laboratory, P.O. Box 682 Newcastle, CA 95658. Analysis has been done by Hydrozoology for the programs entire period of record. Sediment All sediment samples are analyzed by the DWR Soils Laboratory, West Sacramento, CA. Analysis of a sediment sample involves determining the percent size fractions with the use of a mechanical sieve. The sieves sizes are as follow: 75, 37.5, 19, 9.5, 4.75, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6, 0.3, 0.15, 0.075, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001 mm. All particle sizes are found on a regular basis in the samples with the exception of gravel (particles greater than 4.76 mm in diameter). The percent organic content of each sediment sample is also determined from the loss in weight of an oven-dried sample burned at 440 degrees Celsius for 8 hours. All laboratory analysis procedures follow the American Society for Testing Methods, D-2974, Moisture, Ash, and Organic Matterand D-422-63, Particle-Size Analysis of Soil. Works Cited Hymanson, Z., D.

A and the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at the beginning of the year and lower densities for most of the rest of 2019. There were also seasonal peaks of the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis and the amphipods G. daiberi and A. spinicorne.

Figure 29: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A in 2019. Southern Interior Delta Further upstream in the San Joaquin River, site P8 at Buckley Cove was dominated by the sabellid worm M. speciosa which saw peaks in October and March. In addition to this species, which accounted for 59% of all organisms, site P8 saw a diverse community of freshwater oligochaetes, aquatic insects, and amphipods in addition to the non-native clam C. fluminea. At Clifton Court Forebay, freshwater site C9 was dominated by a number of annelid species in 2019. Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri,and Ilyodrilus frantzi were present at high densities throughout the year, at moderately higher levels than in 2018. The amphipod Hyalalla sp. A experienced a dramatic peak in density in November and December (Figure 11). Site C9 is regularly one of our most biodiverse sites, with an additional large number of species present at low densities. Figure 30: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8 in 2019. Figure 31: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9 in 2019. Summary In summary, 2019 saw an overall decrease in invasive clam density from 2018 (13% for P. amurensis and 10% for C. fluminea). Other notable features of 2019 were the sharp decrease in overall density of the amphipod A. abdita in Grizzly Bay, after reaching a decadal peak in 2018, likely due to 2019s decreased salinity, as well as the 2019 increase in the annelid M. speciosa, after its steady decrease from 2015  2018. Our ability to recognize these changes highlights the importance of monitoring benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient since the community has important interactions with various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web.

Benthic communities in 2019 were expected be similar to previous Wet years (2011 and 2017) and differ from drier years both in species composition and in species abundances. Figure 32: Map of EMPs current benthic field sites. San Pablo Bay The most saline of our sites, D41 and D41A, are polyhaline sites in San Pablo Bay. At D41 in 2019, the most numerous species was the non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis, whose density peaked in July to 12,587 individuals per square meter, in a pattern seen primarily in wet years. Site D41 was also notable as the only site where we saw phoronids, also known as horseshoe worms, which are only found in this higher-salinity site. At D41A, there were high densities of the non-native amphipod Ampelisca abdita, which had a high of 9,846 individuals/m2 in December 2019, as well as Potamocorbula amurensis with an average annual density of 1,686 individuals/m2.

Suisun and Grizzly Bay In Suisun Bay and Grizzly Bay in 2019, our mesohaline sites D6 and D7 both saw high numbers of the invasive clam P. amurensis, which had an average density of 9,891 individuals/m2 and comprised 97% of all organisms at D6 in 2019, similar to other recent years. At D7, P. amurensis had a September peak of 12,471 individuals/m2, and the non-native amphipod Corophium alienense had a November peak of 10,428 individuals/m2. These two species together made up 94% of all organisms at D7 in 2019. Figure 35: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6 in 2019. Figure 36: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7 in 2019. Confluence At the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, site D4s oligohaline community was comprised in 2019 largely of the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne and Gammarus daiberi, which each had high variability through the year. The oligochaete worm Varichaetadrilus angustipenis also had high density in the second half of the year. Figure 37: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4 in 2019. Central Delta In the Sacramento River, freshwater site D24 was dominated by the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, whose numbers averaged 3,016 per square meter over the course of 2019, similar to the very high densities of 2018. There was also a significant seasonal increase in densities of the amphipod Gammarus daiberi between September and December. In the San Joaquin River, freshwater site D16 (at Twitchell Island) was dominated in 2019 by the amphipod Gammarus daiberi, which demonstrated an impressive density peak in May, as well as the clam Corbicula fluminea and the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis.

"],["zoop-report.html", "Current Report Data and Contact Info", " Current Report Introduction Zooplankton are a vital trophic link between aquatic primary producers and higher-level consumers of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon into a large and complex food web, historically supporting abundant fisheries in the region (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Many fishes, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton while rearing in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traski) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) feed on zooplankton throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006Feyrer et al. 2003)). Zooplankton in the SFE are also a key food source for several endangered and threatened species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). This importance of zooplankton prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess fish food resources in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Boards Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For nearly 5 decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting the dramatic shifts in the communitys composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have since been linked to major declines of the pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011). This report presents zooplankton annual and seasonal abundance indices and distribution trends from 1974 through 2019 for the most common copepods, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary. Methods Zooplankton sampling has been conducted since 1974 at least once a month March-November through 1995, monthly from 1995 on. at 20 fixed stations in the upper SFE (Figure 1). Three gear types are used for each sampling event: a pump with a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); a Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with a 160-micron mesh for sampling meso-zooplankton (cladocera and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and a mysid net with a 505-micron mesh for sampling mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. Both the mysid and CB nets are attached to a sled and towed obliquely from the bottom through the surface for a 10-minute tow. Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: V=(end meter-start meter)k*a; where V is the volume of water sampled, k is a flowmeter correction value, and a is the area of the mouth of the net. The Teel Marine 12V utility pump is also used at each station to sample approximately 19.8 gallons from the entire water column, which is filtered through a 43-micron mesh net to concentrate the pump sample. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin with Rose Bengal dye before being processed in the laboratory for identification and enumeration of organisms using a dissecting microscope. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata at ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton/. Abundance indices are calculated for each organism based on the gear type most effective at its capture and reported as the mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). CPUE is calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled, so that: CPUE=s*V^(-1); where s is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample. Copepod abundance indices reported here only include adults, as juveniles were not always identified to species. Annual and seasonal abundance indices were calculated using 14 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 1) and 2 non-fixed stations sampled where bottom specific conductance was roughly 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). To analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Seasonal abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected during each season: winter (previous December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and fall (September to November). Long-term seasonal trends for winter are only shown for 1995 to present. Spatial distribution indices for organisms is described as seasonal mean CPUE for by region. Estuary regions were defined as San Pablo Bay (stations D41 and D41A), Suisun Bay (stations D6, 28, 54, and 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32 and S42), West Delta (stations 60, 64, and 74), Central Delta (stations D16, 86, and D28), and the East Delta (92 and M10). Figure 43: Map of fixed Zooplankton Study stations in the San Francisco Estuary. Trends Since the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1974, a significant decrease in the overall abundance of zooplankton has been detected in the estuary (Figure 2). Only the abundance of cyclopoid copepods increased in the region during this period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance in the estuary can be attributed to a series of invasions into the estuary, most notably that of the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). The spread of P. amurensis throughout SFE has had significant impacts on planktonic abundance in the upper estuary due to its high filtration feeding rates on phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. Not only has abundance decreased for most of the zooplankton groups, but dramatic shifts in the composition of these communities have been detected during the study period. These changes have been driven by the introduction and spread of non-native zooplankton species throughout the estuary, compounded with changes to the abiotic and biotic environments. Calanoid copepods While overall calanoid copepod abundance has declined slightly over the study period, community composition has shifted dramatically (Figure 2A). When the study began in the early 1970s the copepods Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp. dominated the calanoid community. The non-native E. affinis was once the primary prey item of the endangered Delta Smelt, but its abundance has declined to a fraction of what it once was, forcing fish to prey switch to more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded introduced calanoid copepods was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and became the most dominant calanoid species in the estuary for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). Then in 1987, after the invasion of P. amurensis, the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was introduced and first detected in the region, competing with the abundant E. affinis (Orsi and Walter 1991). P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. Another introduction occurred in 1993, when the predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in Suisun and the West Delta (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion was hypothesized to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi and calanoid copeopds towards the freshwater zone of the estuary (Figure 3A), as predation on P. forbesi nauplii by A. sinensis has been recorded (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). In general, calanoid copepod abundance is highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months, with lowest abundances during the winter (Figure 4A). While calanoid copepod abundance peaked in the summer of 2017 at a nearly 20 year high, 2018 and 2019 abundance returned to levels comparable to the previous two decades. In 2019 the distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary was similar to 2018, with P. forbesi the most abundant in summer and fall in most of the upper estuary (Figure 4A). The predatory Acartiella sinensis was seen in highest densities in the summer and fall mostly in the Suisun Bay and West Delta regions, similar to 2018. In fall 2019, A. sinensis was the most abundant calanoid in Suisun, where it co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 4B), while P. forbesi was found to the east of Suisun Bay (Hennessy 2018). Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid copepod commonly found in 2019, but it was restricted to Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay in the lower reaches of the estuary. Eurytemora affinis was the most dominant calanoid throughout the upper estuary in the spring of 2019, similar to seasonal distribution patterns of the last two decades.

Cyclopoid copepods While overall zooplankton abundance has declined over the study period, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods exploded (Figure 2B). The native Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were at low abundances when the study began, but with the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s, and the later identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993, cyclopoid indices have increased dramatically(Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999) Abundance indices for the two species of Limnoithona were reported together from 1980 through 2006 as Limnoithona spp., then separately since 2007 when they were identified and enumerated as L. sinensis and L. tetraspina. In 2019, L. tetraspina abundance was the highest observed for all copepods (Figure 2B). Much smaller than calanoid copepods collected in the CB net, the Limnoithona cyclopoids are best retained in pump samples, which use a smaller mesh. Since the early 1990s, Limnoithona spp. abundance has been higher than calanoid copepod abundance, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common copepod in the upper estuary. This increase in L. tetraspina abundance is likely due to a decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE and subsequent decreased predation (Kimmerer 2006), as well as the cyclopoids small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior, making it very difficult for visual feeders to capture (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011). These characteristics may increase its ability to escape predation in a region where visual predation is most dominant among fish (Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is also linked to the reduction of the range of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as high L. tetraspina densities may have fed and sustained larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also fed on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Seasonally, Limnoithona tetraspina peaks in summer and fall (Figure 3B), with lower abundance in winter and spring. As in prior years, this cyclopoid was most abundant in the low-salinity zone of the estuary in Suisun Bay and the West Delta (Figure 4B). Oithona davisae, a native cyclopoid, was the most abundant cyclopoid in the higher-salinity San Pablo Bay in summer and fall (Figure 4B). Cladocera The cladoceran community of the upper estuary is composed of Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma species, whose populations have also substantially declined since the onset of the study (Figure 2C). These cladocera tend to be herbivorous, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, and were likely hard hit by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans make up a significant portion in the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The invasion and increase of available copepod prey such as P. forbesi and the decline in cladocera has created a shift in the nutritional content of the plankton community available for fish, with yet to be determined consequences (Kratina and Winder 2015). While Cladocera abundance has declined overall, recent years summer abundance has been increased and in 2018, summer cladocera abundance was the highest observed since the P. amurensis invasion (Figure 3C). However, in 2019, abundances dropped back down to the lowest seen in almost a decade, with summer abundance slightly higher than other seasons. In the high outflow year of 2017 some cladocera, namely Bosmina, were found downstream in Suisun and the West Delta, while in 2019 the highest densities of cladocera were found in the East Delta, with trace concentrations found in other regions of the estuary (Figure 4C). Figure 46: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE. Spring, summer, and fall are reported for 1974-2018, winter is reported for 1995-2019. A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net. B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples. C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net. D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples. E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net Rotifer While they are the most abundant zooplankton in the estuary, long-term sampling of rotifers using the pump system shows a dramatic decrease in their annual abundance in the estuary since the beginning of this study (Figure 2D). Several species of rotifers make up the community: most abundant being the Polyarthra, Synchaeta, and Keratella genera. Interestingly, the decline of rotifer abundance beginning in the late 1970s preceded the invasion of P. amurensis in the estuary (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The distribution and abundance of rotifers were similar between 2018 and 2019, with abundances similar to those found since the invasion of P. amurensis. Rotifers were the most abundant zooplankton sampled during 2019 (Figure 2) and were found throughout the estuary (Figure 4D). Overall rotifer abundance peaked in the summer and spring (Figure 3D). Keratella and Polyarthra tend to be most abundant in the freshwater and low-salinity zone of the estuary, while Synchaeta species occur most in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun (Figures 3D and 4D)(Winder and Jassby 2011). A spatial and temporal split was discernable between Synchaeta and other rotifers, with Synchaeta having highest densities in the low-salinity zone Bay during the spring, and other rotifers being most abundant in the East Delta in summer. Mysida Not only have mysid abundances declined significantly since the 1970s, but the community has also shifted from being composed almost entirely by the native Neomysis mercedis, to being dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 2E). The first significant decline in N. mercedis occurred during the 1976-1977 drought, likely caused by food limitation from an absence of diatoms due to very low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). The populations of N. mercedis were able to rebound after the years of drought and stayed at high densities in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers crashed. In 1993 the introduced H. longirostris was first detected by this study, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis, and it quickly became the most common mysid in the system. However, overall mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 2E). Mysids have always peaked in the spring and summer months, fluctuating with the higher productivity in the estuary during those seasons (Figure 3E). Historically mysids have been of critical importance in the diets of many fish species in the SFE including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). However, the decline of mysids in the upper estuary has resulted in a significant decrease in their presence in the diets of fishes of the region (Feyrer et al. 2003). This general decline in abundance continued in 2019, even though 2016 and 2017 had a modest peak in mysid abundances (Figure 2E), and the distribution and timing of peaks stayed similar over the last two decades (Hennessy 2018). Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was again the most common mysid in the estuary during all seasons, while the once common and native Neomysis mercedis continued to be almost imperceptible in the region. This has been the overall trend in the estuarys mysid communities since 1994. As in prior years, mysids in 2019 were most abundant during the summer and fall (Figure 3E), and highest concentrations occurred in the low-salinity zone of Suisun Bay and Marsh (Figure 4E). Figure 47: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE for reporting year by region for A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net, B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples, C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net, D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples, and E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net. Conclusion In 2019 the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids at lower densities comparable to other recent years and consistent with the downward historic trends in the estuary. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance peaked in fall, whereas cladocera, rotifers, and mysids peaked in summer. The small, abundant Limnoithona tetraspina was again the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary. This multi-decade zooplankton study has enabled researchers and managers to track the shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for nearly 5 decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the communitys response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.
